## Objective

Developed a high-performance **Distributed Data Parallel** arch, that is memory-efficient image captioning system using a CNN-RNN architecture, specifically leveraging **DenseNet156**,**InceptionV3**,**ResNet50** for feature extraction and both **LSTM** and **GRU** models for sequence generation with attention mechanisms. Implement a robust training recovery mechanism to handle potential crashes and automatically resume from the last saved state. Ensure GPU node's utilization, memory optimization, and extensive visualization for comparative analysis, including comparisons with a Large Language Model (LLM). The system will generate captions and evaluate them using BLEU, CIDEr, METEOR, and ROUGE scores, as well as semantic similarity metrics.
