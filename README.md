Optimized Image Captioning Model with CNN-RNN Architecture and Robust Crash Recovery


## Objective:
Develop a high-performance, memory-efficient image captioning system using CNN-RNN architecture (Inception V3/DenseNet for feature extraction and LSTM/GRU for sequence generation) with a robust training recovery mechanism to handle potential crashes and automatically resume from the last saved state. Additionally, ensure GPU utilization, memory optimization, and extensive visualization for comparative analysis with a Large Language Model (LLM). The system will generate captions and evaluate them using BLEU scores and semantic similarity metrics.

## Core Requirements:
GPU Utilization and Memory Optimization:

Use mixed precision training (FP16) for improved GPU performance and memory savings.
Implement gradient checkpointing to reduce memory usage during backpropagation, especially for large datasets like MSCOCO.
Ensure efficient batch processing and caching of image embeddings to avoid recomputation.
Image Feature Extraction:

Extract embeddings using Inception V3 and DenseNet models (penultimate layer output).
Cache embeddings to avoid recomputation and optimize processing with GPU batch handling.
Visualize embeddings using PCA/TSNE to compare feature spaces between models and datasets.
RNN-Based Caption Generation (LSTM/GRU with Attention):

Implement both LSTM and GRU models with an attention mechanism (Bahdanau or Luong Attention) for improved context handling during caption generation.
Use teacher forcing to accelerate convergence and better sequence generation.
Optimize models for memory efficiency with mixed precision training and gradient checkpointing.
Perform error analysis to identify discrepancies in generated captions and provide qualitative insights.
LLM-Based Caption Generation:

Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) for caption generation, leveraging GPU for inference.
Compare LLM-generated captions with those produced by LSTM/GRU models.
Evaluation and Visualization:

Evaluate captions using BLEU scores and semantic similarity metrics (Word2Vec/GloVe embeddings).
Extensive visualizations:
Attention weight maps for LSTM/GRU.
Side-by-side comparisons of actual vs. generated captions.
Embedding visualizations (PCA/TSNE) for Inception V3 and DenseNet models.
Compare resource usage (memory and inference time) across all models.
Crash Recovery and Training Continuity:
Model Checkpointing:

Save model weights, biases, and optimizer state after every epoch or batch.
Ensure checkpoints include necessary metadata to resume training seamlessly.
Automatic Crash Recovery:

Detect crashes and automatically resume training from the last saved checkpoint without losing progress.
Implement file integrity checks to ensure checkpoint validity and prevent corrupted files from causing training failures.
Asynchronous saving of checkpoints to avoid slowing down training.
Environment Health Monitoring:

Monitor GPU usage, memory usage, and disk space to avoid crashes due to resource exhaustion.
Set up alerts for potential resource issues.
Hyperparameter Tuning and Scalability:

Implement hyperparameter tuning (batch size, learning rate, sequence length) based on dataset size.
Ensure multi-GPU support for faster processing of larger datasets like MSCOCO.
Introduce a learning rate scheduler to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training.
